# Steam description

[//]: # (start)
Steam description transliterated from `steam.bbcode` by [our release script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellaris-mods/scripts/master/stlrel).

## **Tinyifies your list of ship designs\!**
Compatible with 1080/1440 addons and all addons that add new ships\.

**_I do not actually play Stellaris, I only make mods\. That is how I have fun\. Since I do not actually play, I have no idea what would be best for you\. Please give me written feedback\._**

I made this because of some confusing things that happened:

1. I took over the development of another addon, ShipDesignerCompactor
1. The UI Overhaul 1080p mod guys took my SDC code (I let them) and put it into theirs, but they kept the category headings
1. To make SDC even smaller than 1080, I removed the ship category headings
1. Some people apparently miss the categories


So, eh, whatever\. Here is an alternative? :\-P

I made some addons that tinyify other things:
